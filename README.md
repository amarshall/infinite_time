# InfiniteTime

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/amarshall/infinite_time.png)](http://travis-ci.org/amarshall/infinite_time)

Provides a representation of a (positively or negatively) infinite time. This allows easier comparison with times when, for instance, you have an end date for an object but it is not yet known. Using `nil` would cause TypeErrors everywhere and you must then guard against that.

## Installation

Install as usual: `gem install infinite_time` or add `gem 'infinite_time'` to your Gemfile.

## Usage

TODO
